# AstroTinker Bot
This project was created as part of the eYRC 2023-24 competition. The theme, "AstroTinker (AT) Bot", revolves around a scenario where a robot is dispatched to a space station, divided into different modules, to rectify any problems that arise.

## Project Overview

AstroTinker Bot is designed to navigate through various modules of a space station, responding to wireless alerts from the central hub. The robot locates faulty or missing components, communicates the issue to the central hub, and retrieves the necessary components from the electronics warehouse for repairs.

## Features

- **FPGA-Based Design:** Utilizes a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to control sensors and actuators.
- **Environment Perception:** Equipped with sensors to perceive and navigate the environment.
- **Component Handling:** Capable of drag-and-drop operations to handle essential components.
- **Wireless Communication:** Uses wireless communication to exchange vital information with the central hub.
- **Custom CPU Architecture:** Implements a sophisticated CPU architecture using Verilog HDL to leverage FPGA's parallel processing capabilities.

## Hardware and Software

- **FPGA:** The powerhouse of the robot, enabling precise control over sensors and actuators.
- **Sensors:** Various sensors to navigate and interact with the environment.
- **Actuators:** For movement and component handling.
- **Wireless Modules:** For communication with the central hub.
- **Verilog HDL:** Used to design the custom CPU architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AstroTinker Bot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed for FPGA development and wireless communication.

3. **Load the FPGA Configuration:** Use your preferred FPGA development environment to load the Verilog HDL code onto the FPGA.

4. **Run the Bot:** Power up the bot and start the mission!
